# circuitpython-denon-remote-control 3D printer files

I have little experience in using CAD programs and some time in the future I will redesign this properly.

You will need to print the faceplate to the ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT from Printables.  [BlitzCityDIY created a faceplate](https://www.printables.com/model/392357-circuitpython-octoprint-controller-and-monitor-cas/files) to be used with the speaker stand.  Download the file simpleLid_V0.stl.  After attaching the simple_lid to the Feather, it should press fit into the speaker stand.

Included is the 3MF, STEP, and STL files for 3D printing the speaker stand for an AudioEngine P4 or A5.
