# circuitpython-denon-remote-control 3D printer files

I have little experience in using CAD programs and some time in the future I will redesign this properly.  All of these files were created in OnShape and are available publicly there or download here.

You will need to print the faceplate to the ESP32-S2 Reverse TFT from Printables.  [BlitzCityDIY created a faceplate](https://www.printables.com/model/392357-circuitpython-octoprint-controller-and-monitor-cas/files) to be used with the speaker stand.  Download the file simpleLid_V0.stl.  After attaching the simple_lid to the Feather, it should press fit into the speaker stand.

The included files are:

* Reverse TFT Feather Speaker Stand (STL, STEP, or 3MF available): This is the work in process speaker stand that includes the Reverse TFT, Stemma QT Rotary Encoder, and right angle USB-C cable / connector.
* Angled Speaker Stand (STL, STEP or 3MF): The original model I started with that does not include any cutouts (you could use this for your other speaker.)
* Rounded Speaker Stand(STL, STEP, 3MF): The Angled Speaker Stand, but with a filet and chamfer.
